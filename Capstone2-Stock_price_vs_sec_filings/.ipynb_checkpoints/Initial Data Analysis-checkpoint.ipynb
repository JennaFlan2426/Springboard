    "Thinking out loud, at the beginning:\n",
    "    - Wow these files are big, I'm going to need to pare down the data probably a lot.\n",
    "    - First going to be looking for \"what's the most complete data that I have for what span of time\"?\n",
    "    - What data do I actually want to focus on? (record some research on how, broadly, one comes up with a company valuation that could be comparable to market capitalization)\n",
    "    - I probably should focus my market data gathering on the day after each SEC filing is released, assuming that will be the day that stock price movements are most influenced by the filing information rather than other news or factors.\n",
    "    - My core question so far is, are market prices correlated with valuation information in some fashion?\n",
    "        - If so, which valuation information is most strongly correlated?\n",
    "        - What, if any, is the relationship between stock price/market capitalization and the business's balance sheet?\n",
    "        - Do any of these data include attempts to put a value on intangibles such as goodwill/reputation?\n",
    "        - The fundamental analysis tradition focuses on ratios of price to earnings, book value, earnings growth; do the ratios that investors find acceptable change over time? Do they tend to change back (or ahead) when SEC filings are released?\n",
    "        - (Do I have time for this?) What happens in the periods between filings? Do prices maintain a range, like the moving average support/resistance bands favored by technical analysis?\n",
    "    - Therefore, what am I looking for in the data I've found so far?\n",
    "        - As much history as I can assemble from both market data and SEC filings; will need to drop years where I have one but not the other.\n",
    "        - Focus on the Fortune 100, probably choose the 100 as of the most recent year I have data for.\n",
    "        - Market data at daily granularity, hopefully with open, high, low, and close prices for each day. Probably focus on dates related to the company's SEC filings.\n",
    "        - Still deciding what SEC filing information, partially I don't know what I have to work with yet, hoping for a moderately quick thumbnail of value related to assets, liabilities, and maybe intangibles/goodwill. Assuming earnings-per-share numbers also will be found here.\n",
    "        - If market data has already calculated P/E or other ratios, great, I can use those to sanity-check what I'm pulling in from SEC."
