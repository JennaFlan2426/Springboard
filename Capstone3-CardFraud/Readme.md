# Detecting Fraud in Credit Card Transactions
===============================

By using a Kaggle dataset of anonymized credit card transactions, I created a model to help identify fraudulent transactions. This is a naturally imbalanced dataset; we hope, at least, that fraud constitutes a very small portion of financial transactions. In this specific case the positive class (actually fraud) was 0.017% of the dataset. I used the imbalanced-learn module and tested various methods like undersampling and oversampling to assist in model training. Utilizing a variety of techniques like logistic regression, support vector classifier, extra trees classifier, and model stacking, I developed a model that predicted 95% of true positives with very low false positives.
