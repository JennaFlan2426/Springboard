    "    - and to https://www.kaggle.com/hazratnit/credit-fraud-detection\n",
    "    - easy/difficult visualization from https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283349138_Calibrating_Probability_with_Undersampling_for_Unbalanced_Classification (Section III-D)\n",
    "    - Data has already been run through PCA, except for \"Time\" and \"Amount\" which will need to be scaled to match the remaining columns\n",
    "    - Do the usual checking for nulls, describe T/A columns, visualize\n",
    "    - State mean/min/max of amount; percentage positive/negative\n",
    "    - Do correlation heatmap\n",
    "    - Do boxplots of highly positive/negative correlations\n",
    "    - Do easy/difficult histplots of the high correlations\n",
    "    - Consider outlier correction\n",
    "    - Scratch notebook: http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Capstone3-CardFraud/Data%20Wrangling.ipynb\n",
    "- Feature Engineering\n",
    "    - Will need to subsample and/or oversample to balance classes\n",
    "    - Do comparative heatmaps, boxplots, histplots (see if I can save images from EDA)"
