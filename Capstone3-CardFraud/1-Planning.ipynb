    "## Action Plan\n",
    "- Data Visualization, EDA, and cleaning\n",
    "    - Credit to https://www.kaggle.com/janiobachmann/credit-fraud-dealing-with-imbalanced-datasets\n",
    "    - and to https://www.kaggle.com/hazratnit/credit-fraud-detection\n",
    "    - easy/difficult visualization from https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283349138_Calibrating_Probability_with_Undersampling_for_Unbalanced_Classification (Section III-D)\n",
    "    - Data has already been run through PCA, except for \"Time\" and \"Amount\" which will need to be scaled to match the remaining columns\n",
    "    - Do the usual checking for nulls, describe T/A columns, visualize\n",
    "    - State mean/min/max of amount; percentage positive/negative\n",
    "    - Do correlation heatmap\n",
    "    - Do boxplots of highly positive/negative correlations\n",
    "    - Do easy/difficult histplots of the high correlations\n",
    "    - Consider outlier correction\n",
    "    - Scratch notebook: http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Capstone3-CardFraud/Data%20Wrangling.ipynb\n",
    "- Wrangling part 2: scaling and resampling\n",
    "    - Scale \"amount\" and \"time\" features to match remaining\n",
    "    - Check \"info\" on features to confirm scale\n",
    "    - Will need to subsample and/or oversample to balance classes\n",
    "    - Do comparative heatmaps, boxplots, histplots (see if I can save images from EDA)\n",
    "    - Retry easy/difficult visualization on sampled data\n",
    "    - Do the sampling BEFORE train/test splitting (! no, other way around? https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/common_pitfalls.html)\n",
    "    - Remember outlier corrections\n",
    "    - Try both subsampling and oversampling to see if either produces \"better\" results\n",
    "    - Extra credit: repeat from the sampling step as a kind of cross-validation of the sampling tactic\n",
    "    - Scratch notebook: http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Capstone3-CardFraud/Wrangling%202-scaling%20and%20resampling.ipynb\n",
    "- Model Building\n",
    "    - Try several \"simple\" models for classification (pycaret or manual?)\n",
    "    - Compare with a neural net model\n",
    "    - to test: using sklearn class weight parameter instead of resampling (logistic/random forest)\n",
    "    - use extratrees model instead of random forest\n",
    "    - Try creating extra features with square/cube (see sklearn polynomial features)\n",
    "    - Possibly, test my favorite model with outlier removal."
